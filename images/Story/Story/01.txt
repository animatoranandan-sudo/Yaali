#	Scene Title / Tagline	FIRST HALF
1	Tribute Dawn	At the island palace, Queen Meghana and Minister Sidh oversee tax carts bound for the Empire. The air is heavy with unease as drums echo from the distant towers.
2	Waterfall Ambush	Masked Ruthra attacks the convoy at the mountain valley bridge; gold scatters through mist as horses rear and guards fall—his rebellion begins.
3	Tunnel Escape	Ruthra dives into the underground waterway, disappearing beneath roaring falls; fisherman Koran opens the gate and hides the stolen chests in coral caves.
4	Bell Alarm Network	Across the valley, signal bells thunder; riders on horseback race between towers, passing coded scrolls to nearby camps—the Empire’s surveillance awakens.
5	Viruka’s Wrath	In the capital’s marble court, Rajaguru Viruka receives the alarm scroll, slams his staff, and roars, “Find the thief—or burn their colonies.”
6	Island Decree	A royal messenger delivers the edict: double tribute if the thief is island-born. The Queen and Sidh swear loyalty, unaware the culprit is their own prince.
7	Beach Resolve	Ruthra overhears the decree; guilt hardens into vow—he will end the Empire’s greed from within. Waves crash as he looks toward the mainland.
8	Tunnel Departure	At night, Koran warns, “The sea returns none twice.” Ruthra dons a travel cloak and vanishes into the underwater route toward the outer world.
9	Karuppusamy Illusion	Near the coastal guard post, Ruthra lights torches behind a tribal idol; shifting shadows make it appear alive. Terrified soldiers flee, and he slips past unseen.
10	Capital Infiltration	Emerging on the mainland, Ruthra hides among traders, mapping treasury routes while seeing the cruelty of the Empire up close.

14	Pazhi Valley Rituals	Hidden behind rocks, Ruthra watches the Pazhi tribe sculpt Yali idols and train with wild beasts using rhythmic stone-clicks and chants.
15	Elder’s Lesson	An old tribal seer teaches the children: “Fear takes form; when you face it, it bows.” Ruthra absorbs the truth that strength is awareness, not rage.
16	Return to Island	At dawn, he slips through the tunnels home; Koran notices his calm eyes—something in the prince has changed.
17	Royal Summons	An imperial scroll commands all colony ministers to appear before the King; Queen urges Sidh to go, fearing disobedience.
18	Shadow Journey	Sidh leaves with guards toward the capital; Ruthra secretly follows through ravines, unseen under moonlight.
19 A	Council Hall — Floating Stone Demand	At the grand council, Rajaguru Viruka demands floating stones from Sidh’s island for the new temple. Sidh agrees reluctantly. As he departs, he hears sculptors whispering of a coming Narabali—a royal-blood sacrifice.
19 B	Astrologer’s Warning	Outside the city walls, Sidh consults an aged astrologer who reveals the ritual’s rule: “Only an unscarred royal empowers the Sword; one wound spares his life.” Sidh realizes Ruthra is the target and resolves to protect him.
20	Second Encounter / The Lie	That night near the palace outskirts, Ruthra meets Kshala again, catching her stealing grain. Seeing Sidh’s apparent obedience, he misjudges him: “He betrayed us. Bring him alive—I’ll question another.” Kshala, believing she fights for her tribe, agrees.
21	The Trap Is Set	Back on the island, Sidh plans a hunting trip to fake-wound Ruthra and save him. Ruthra quietly changes the location—to Kshala’s chosen ambush ground.
22	The Ambush — Clash of Intentions	In the forest clearing, Kshala strikes first—taking down guards with fierce agility. Ruthra, unmasked as the Prince, steps to defend Sidh. Confusion erupts; believing him an imperial ally, Kshala knocks Ruthra down the slope toward the river.
23	The River Fall	Ruthra crashes through foliage into the shallow stream below. Kshala glimpses only movement, assumes her masked friend is nearby, and captures the stunned Sidh before vanishing into the mist.
24	The Interrogation — Night of Truths	Inside an abandoned watch-house, Kshala binds Sidh. Ruthra, bruised and hidden behind a cracked wall, listens as Sidh confesses the Narabali prophecy, the cave betrayal, and Raya’s murder of Cheliya and Guru Kala.
25	The Emotional Break	Kshala realizes she has captured an innocent man. Sidh’s final whisper—“The heir lives, protected by me”—freezes the night. Behind the wall, Ruthra silently collapses in grief and guilt.

•	PROLOGUE: THE CAVE OF DESTINY
•	

•	SCENE 1: THE ARRIVAL
•	SETTING: EXT. STONE FOREST ASHRAM - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: The entrance of the Ancient Stone Forest Ashram is framed by towering stone pillars that resemble fossilized trees, defining the landscape of Mystical Realism. Two young men, CHELIYA (thoughtful, restrained) and RAAYA (ambitious, intense), stand at the threshold. They are Princes, but their attire is simple, reflecting their quest for mastery of both body and mind. The silence here is weighted with ancient discipline.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 2: GURU KALA'S WELCOME
•	SETTING: INT. ASHRAM COURTYARD - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: GURU KALA, elderly, stern, but possessing a deep, quiet authority, greets the princes. He is dressed in minimal robes. The courtyard is Spartan. The Guru's voice carries, reminding them sharply that this holy place values discipline over brute force. Raaya shifts impatiently, while Cheliya bows, absorbing the instruction fully.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 3: CONTRASTING TRAINING
•	SETTING: EXT. ASHRAM TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: A kinetic montage of training. They practice stances, footwork, and precision strikes. Raaya trains aggressively, his movements powerful and centered on overpowering an imagined foe. Cheliya focuses inwardly, prioritizing balanced breathing and the meditative accuracy of the strike. Their contrasting approaches are clear: Raaya seeks conquest; Cheliya seeks control.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 4: THE LESSON ON CHOICE
•	SETTING: INT. ASHRAM CLASSROOM - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: Guru Kala is teaching. His lesson is pivotal: “Life presents choices; the choices we make decide who we become.” This universal wisdom splits their paths: Cheliya accepts this as a call to righteous action; Raaya sees it as validation for choosing the path that guarantees his own supremacy.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 5: CONTRASTING NATURES
•	SETTING: EXT. ASHRAM GROUNDS - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: Guru Kala watches from afar. Cheliya is seen patiently helping weaker students, spending time correcting their form. Simultaneously, Raaya is asserting dominance in a sparring match, his victory unnecessarily humiliating to his opponent. The Guru's eyes track both, his understanding of their ultimate fates crystallizing.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 6: THE PILGRIMAGE SELECTION
•	SETTING: INT. ASHRAM COURTYARD - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: Guru Kala selects both Cheliya and Raaya for a sacred pilgrimage. He specifies their destination: a mountain cave—a journey intended to test the soul, not strength. Raaya's excitement is tempered with impatience; Cheliya accepts the challenge with solemn reverence.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 7: THE SAINT AND THE CLEARING
•	SETTING: EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH / CLEARING - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: Deep within the forest, the princes encounter a small, sun-dappled clearing. A serene Saint sits in profound meditation. Nearby, a gentle deer grazes peacefully. The scene is one of profound, vulnerable calm.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 8: INTERVENTION OF COMPASSION
•	SETTING: EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH / CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: A large python silently slithers from the shadows toward the unsuspecting deer. Cheliya, driven purely by compassion, acts on instinct. He quickly throws his bow, causing a loud CLATTER that successfully startles the deer into fleeing from the snake.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 9: THE IRONY OF FATE
•	SETTING: EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH / CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: The deer, having escaped the python, leaps blindly—and lands directly into the jaws of a hidden tiger. The Saint opens his eyes. He speaks softly, addressing the horrified princes: “Fate cannot be changed; your kindness fulfilled its destiny.” Cheliya is deeply shaken by the terrible outcome of his virtuous action.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 10: THE NARROW LEDGE
•	SETTING: EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF FACE - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: The princes move along a terrifyingly narrow balancing ledge high above a deep, misty valley. The challenge is to maintain focus and emotional clarity despite the sheer drop. Cheliya moves with practiced mindfulness; Raaya strains against the necessary slowness, his agitation visible.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 11: THE COLLAPSING PATH
•	SETTING: EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: They arrive at a section where the stone path is collapsing. Cheliya chooses the stable, mindful, and longer way. Raaya, impatient and reckless, charges through the risky shortcut, barely making it across as the stones crumble behind him. The choice perfectly illustrates their contrasting views on safety, risk, and discipline.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 12: THE CAVE OF DESTINY
•	SETTING: EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
•	DESCRIPTION: The path ends at a monumental cave entrance—the Cave of Destiny. The rock face trembles with an ancient rumbling. Glowing symbols etched into the stone flicker around the vast opening, beckoning them into the dark.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 13: THE RELICS
•	SETTING: INT. CAVE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: Inside the cave chamber, two relics wait on stone pedestals. The ethereal Wing Core glows with a gentle, calming light—the image of calm power. The fearsome Sword of Pride radiates a harsh, deep red—the lure of dominance. Cheliya feels a quiet draw toward the Wings; Raaya is magnetically pulled to the Sword.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 14: CORRUPTION AND CLARITY
•	SETTING: INT. CAVE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: They touch the relics. The cave flares violently. Cheliya is suffused with serene clarity by the Wings, his fear dissipating. Raaya is instantly corrupted by the Sword, his eyes burning with surging arrogance and limitless ambition. The choice has decided who they have become.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 15: THE DUEL
•	SETTING: INT. CAVE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: Consumed by ambition, Raaya attacks. The Sword of Pride cuts the air, glowing red. Cheliya, propelled by the defensive awareness of the Wing Core, tries to defend himself without killing his former brother-in-training. The duel is quick, brutal, and tragic.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 16: THE FALL
•	SETTING: INT. CAVE CHAMBER / ABYSS - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: Raaya overpowers him. Cheliya is struck down and spirals into a deep abyss within the cave floor. As he falls, the Wing Core shatters above the chasm, exploding into a shower of brilliant, fading light.
•	________________________________________
•	SCENE 17: SHADOWS OF THE WING
•	SETTING: EXT. VOID / DARKNESS - CONTINUOUS
•	DESCRIPTION: Absolute blackness. A slow-motion shot of a single, broken white feather drifting silently in the darkness. Then, stillness. The final title appears over the void, stark white against black
